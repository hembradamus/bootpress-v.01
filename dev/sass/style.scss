Description: BootPress' primary goal is to provide as clean and scalable a foundation as possible for building Bootstrap-based themes. This themes template files emulate a standard WordPress Twenty_____ theme, but rely on soley on Bootstrap for styling and respnosiveness in order to eliminate conflicts and redundancies from other themes. In addition to providing a cleaner starting point, BootPress also incorporates Bootstrap completely separate from its template files in order to make future Bootstrap updates more painless and reversible.
