Theme Name: BootPress
Theme URI: 
Description: BootPress strives to provide the cleanest and most scalable foundation possible for building Bootstrap-based themes. This theme's template files emulate a standard WordPress Twenty-xxxxx theme, but rely on soley on Bootstrap for styling and respnosiveness in order to eliminate conflicts and redundancies from other themes. Additionally, BootPress's template files do not directly contain any Bootstrap classes so that themes built on top of it can incorporate future Bootstrap updates more painlessly/reversibly.
